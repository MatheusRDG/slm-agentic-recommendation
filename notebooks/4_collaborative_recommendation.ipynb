Our CDs are professionally resurfaced and are guaranteed to work or your money back! These listings are for the disc only and do not come with the case, album art, or inserts. If you have any questions about the CDs, please do not hesitate to get in touch. Amazon.com Overwhelmed by sudden success, Nirvana promised to take a harsher, more abrasive route on their second major-label release. Enlisting Chicago-based noise maven Steve Albini (of Big Black fame), Kurt Cobain and company succeeded in producing a record that was violent, disillusioned, and deeply moving. Every song reads like a commentary on the cost of fame (\"Serve the Servants\") and the unhealthy relationship between performer and fan (\"Milk It\"). Of course, they might all simply be about Courtney Love . Gossip aside, there is no denying the sheer power of Cobain's songwriting, his singing, and the band's amazing, visceral power. Cobain even manages a John Lennon -like mantra at the end of the heart-wrenching \"All Apologies.\" \"All in all is all we are,\" he intones repeatedly, only for Cobain that's no consolation. --Percy Keegan\n",

      "User comment: I think I'm one of the very few diehards that believes 'In Utero' was not Nirvanas best studio album. Now dont get me wrong, it is far from a bad album, justifying the four star rating, but there are many crudentials lacking of 'In Utero' that aren't as lacking on 'Bleach'. However, some of Nirvanas best and most beautiful songs can be found here; songs like 'Heart Shaped Box', with its depressing lyrics about Kurts heroine addiction and his misfortune that befell him soon after he was hooked, \"forever in debt to your priceless advise\" lets us know that Cobain would much rather have chosen a drug-free path. 'Rape Me' was Kurts anti-Teen Spirit. It is a song about how SLTS \"raped\" Nirvana of their undergroung status and turned them into alternative heroes. \"Rape me my friend\" describes how Kurt almost felt betrayed, because, as most Nirvana fans know, he loved SLTS when he made it, but then after it made him famous its almost as if he despised it. 'Dumb' is a soft ballad and is about the feelings you have when you're high with lyrics like \"I think I'm dumb\" and \"We'll float aroung, hang out on clouds\". 'All Apologies' is another ballad, but unlike 'Dumb' it is loud at times. It is a ballad to his wife Courtney Love (who has since ruined Cobains great legacy) and infant daughter Francis Bean, and how he felt like everything that happened to them was his fault. 'Serve the Servants', the opener to the album, is a great rocker that explains the high price of fame. And 'Very Ape' is a bit different, but it has one hell of a catchy riff. As usual Dave Grohl is top knotch, but I do think Novoselic did better on previous albums, I dont know.<br /><br />  The other half of 'In Utero' however, isn't so great. 'Scentless Apprentice' sounds too much like 'Aneurysm', with its its rising riff. 'Milk It' can often times sound pointless, and although the riff is good, it just doesn't make up for what the song lacks. 'Pennyroyal Tea' lacks the insightful lyrics of previous ballads, and although isn't bad, it just doesn't meet my expectations. 'Tourrettes' is just dumb. I know Cobain was originally influenced by punk, but its nothing when compared to other punk driven songs like 'Territorial Pissings' and 'Aneurysm'. 'Francis Farmer...' and 'Radio Friendly Unit Shifter' arent bad, butthey get boring after a while. And also Cobain may sound like he's being coninuously shot in the leg with his banshee screaming. But most of the time he sounds alright.<br /><br />  So, while there may seem to be a lot of things wrong with this, it is overall a 4 star, thanks to classic songs like 'Heart-shaped Box', 'Rape me', and 'All Apologies'. I think any grunge fan should own this, oh, and pick up 'Bleach' too, its Nirvanas best.\n",

      "User comment: First of all if it wasn't for Black Sabbath then most likely there would be no metal today. Although Black Sabbath wasn't the earliest metal band (that would be Deep Purple) they still added many new twists to the genre. This band was dark, eerie, and definitely evil (for its time, anyway) and in Paranoid people started getting into this growing genre.<br /><br />  While Deep Purple provided the loudness and Led Zeppelin provided the attitude, Black Sabbath brought the evil into metal. Songs like 'Electric Funeral', 'Hand of Doom', and 'Planet Caravan' explain such evil. Popular songs like 'Paranoid' and 'Iron Man' brought catchiness to Black Sabbath, while still maintaining complexity and talent. Other songs, such as 'Fairies Wear Boots' start out with only instruments and then has Ozzy come in with his eerie vocals. 'War Pigs' has lyrics about Vietnam (keep in mind this was made in '70). Tony Iommi is among the best guitarists ever. The guy lost many fingertips in an accident at a Birmingham factory. While most guitarists would probably quit right there Iommi didn't only continue, but excell. Geezer Butler is a fast-as-hell bassist who laid the foundation for many metal bassists. Bill Ward is a decent drummer, and although he never came close to Jon Bonham from Zeppelin, he still provided the backbone to Sabbath. We all know about Ozzy and his eerie vocals/lyrics, I shouldn't need to write anything.<br /><br />  If you like rock n' roll, then you should already have this. If you dont, well I shouldn't have to tell you anything now.\n",

      "Description: Product Description 50 Cent's highly anticipated follow-up to 'Get Rich Or DieTryin' features production by Dr. Dre and guest shots by Eminem, Lloyd Banks, and many more The first single 'Candy Shop' has been getting major radio airplay as well as 'Disco Inferno'. Aftermath. 2005. Amazon.com 50 Cent is now a full two dollars, according to pop culture exchange rates. His sheer influence on music charts, and thugs hearts, changed things. So why then on Massacre is the 'hood drama that one would think he'd want to leave behind even more front-and-center than on Get Rich or Die Tryin' ? It's hard to say, but 50's developed a questionable gun fetish here. With firearms plastered all over the liner notes, and throughout most of his lyrics--on \"In My Hood\" he retorts \"I don't go nowhere without my strap\"--apparently his nouveau rich status has only accelerated the number of enemies he's accumulated. On \"I'm Supposed to Die Tonight\" he even awkwardly forecasts Notorious B.I.G. -like, Tupac -ian rap game death scenarios. \"Piggy Bank,\" a virtual diss fest further cements his \"How to Rob\" persona as Nas and Fat Joe get the lyrical smack down; so does A-list actor Vivica Fox (\"Get In My Car\") for even daring to consider their rendezvous to be anything more than a fling. Despite beat contributions from Aftermath hombres (Eminem, Dr. Dre), some of the better beats come courtesy of lesser-known beatsmiths like Disco D (\"Ski Mask Way\") and the always consistent Hi-Tek, whose \"Ryder Music\" is a sick concoction of keys and haunting vocals. At 22 tracks (with no inane interludes), it's worth the loot, but it doesn't cover up 50's artistic regression since Get Rich . -- Dalton Higgins Co-Conspirators' Greatest Hits The Eminem Show , Eminem The Chronic , Dr. Dre Olivia , Olivia The Slim Shady LP , Eminem Hi-Teknology , Hi-Tek Straight out tha Trunk , Disco D\n",

I thought it couldn't get any worse, but how wrong I was...This has to be one of the crappiest \"albums\" (I refer to it as a frisbee) I've ever heard. I was at my dads house one day, and my sister Ashley was blasting this crap through the radio. I said \"What the hell is that noise\". She said \"It be da new fiddy CD\" (Yes, she is white). I got so sick of it in 3 seconds that I got a headache, and I just decided to go to my friend Vince's house. We were going to play frisbee because there was nothing else to do, but alas, no fribee. I knew what I had to do. I went back to my house and stole the CD from my sisters sterio, she was watching The Wrong World in the living room. When I made it back to Vinces he had found a basketball, so I just decided to frisbee the plastic in the garbage. It makes a GREAT frisbee! But I now use it as a coaster, because I ended up breaking the edge and now it wont fly straight, dammit. Oh well, if you want to spend $15 on a really thin, 6 inch plastic frisbee, then this is what to buy, but DO NOT, I repeat, DO NOT put this in your sterio/CD player/radio/anything that plays plastic such as this.<br />  Update 7/22/05<br />That guy \"MTV Rocks\", yeah what a stupid f**k. I normally dont make fun of peoples opinions because they do have a right to believe what they want. But this guy insults great bands like Van Halen, Megadeth, and Steve Vai while worshipping godawful crap such as \"fiddy\" here. Sorry \"MTV rocks\" but you, Bush, and eMpTyV are why most countries hate the USA. (this used to be a great country in the 60's - 90's, what happened?)\n",

However, some of Nirvanas best and most beautiful songs can be found here; songs like \\'Heart Shaped Box\\', with its depressing lyrics about Kurts heroine addiction and his misfortune that befell him soon after he was hooked, \"forever in debt to your priceless advise\" lets us know that Cobain would much rather have chosen a drug-free path. \\'Rape Me\\' was Kurts anti-Teen Spirit. It is a song about how SLTS \"raped\" Nirvana of their undergroung status and turned them into alternative heroes. \"Rape me my friend\" describes how Kurt almost felt betrayed, because, as most Nirvana fans know, he loved SLTS when he made it, but then after it made him famous its almost as if he despised it. \\'Dumb\\' is a soft ballad and is about the feelings you have when you\\'re high with lyrics like \"I think I\\'m dumb\" and \"We\\'ll float aroung, hang out on clouds\". \\'All Apologies\\' is another ballad, but unlike \\'Dumb\\' it is loud at times. It is a ballad to his wife Courtney Love (who has since ruined Cobains great legacy) and infant daughter Francis Bean, and how he felt like everything that happened to them was his fault. \\'Serve the Servants\\', the opener to the album, is a great rocker that explains the high price of fame. And \\'Very Ape\\' is a bit different, but it has one hell of a catchy riff. As usual Dave Grohl is top knotch, but I do think Novoselic did better on previous albums, I dont know.<br /><br />  The other half of \\'In Utero\\' however, isn\\'t so great. \\'Scentless Apprentice\\' sounds too much like \\'Aneurysm\\', with its its rising riff. \\'Milk It\\' can often times sound pointless, and although the riff is good, it just doesn\\'t make up for what the song lacks. \\'Pennyroyal Tea\\' lacks the insightful lyrics of previous ballads, and although isn\\'t bad, it just doesn\\'t meet my expectations. \\'Tourrettes\\' is just dumb. I know Cobain was originally influenced by punk, but its nothing when compared to other punk driven songs like \\'Territorial Pissings\\' and \\'Aneurysm\\'. \\'Francis Farmer...\\' and \\'Radio Friendly Unit Shifter\\' arent bad, butthey get boring after a while.
